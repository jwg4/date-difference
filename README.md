All of the project is either the work of the various stackoverflow contributors in their replies, or my own work. Each class which implements IDateDifference is named with the username of the contributor in question. My contributions to these files are small and mechanical - changing the signatures of functions and so on to make them uniform.

TimePeriod is a separate project which is licensed under the Code Project Open License. It is included in this project without modification as a convenience.
